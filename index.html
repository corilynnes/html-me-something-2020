<h2> VENICE</h2>
<p>I wish I could live in Venice, but at 700&euro; per square foot (roughly $1000 per square foot). That is not happening.
   I loved the lack of streets and endless systems of alleyways that you could get lost in and yet easily find your way back home. One evening we stumbled on a residential area
   that was not crawling with tourists. We found a small potluck celebrating Venice with a band, food, and Venice merchandise. Then shortly
   after we stumbled on a small band playing at another old well courtyard with people dancing and singling along. <br>
   For a couple days, I had been trying to hunt down a cotton Venetian flag to bring home. I fonally found one in a small shop and the 
   cashier was so excited to practice his English and give me a history lesson about the flag and city. Speaking of history, Venice has such a rich 
   history which includes being excommunicated six times. St. Mark became their patron saint by well, being stolen, literally. Venetian 
   merchants stole the body of St. Mark to build a cathedral around his bones. You can find his loin not only on their flag, but also
   as statues all round the city, many of which depict it being liberated by Lady Liberty.
