                    <h2> VENICE</h2>
                    <p>I wish I could live in Venice, but at 700&euro; per square foot (roughly
                        $1000
                        per
                        square foot). That is not
                        happening.
                        I loved the lack of streets and endless systems of alleyways that you could get lost in and yet
                        easily
                        find your
                        way back home. One evening we stumbled on a residential area
                        that was not crawling with tourists. We found a small potluck celebrating Venice with a band,
                        food,
                        and
                        Venice
                        merchandise. Then shortly
                        after we stumbled on a small band playing at another old well courtyard with people dancing and
                        singling
                        along.
                        <br><br>
                        For a couple days, I had been trying to hunt down a cotton Venetian flag to bring home. I
                        finally
                        found
                        one in a
                        small shop and the
                        cashier was so excited to practice his English and give me a history lesson about the flag and
                        city.
                        Speaking of
                        history, Venice has such a rich
                        history which includes being excommunicated six times. St. Mark became their patron saint by
                        well,
                        being
                        stolen,
                        literally. Venetian
                        merchants stole the body of St. Mark to build a cathedral around his bones. You can find his
                        loin
                        not
                        only on
                        their flag, but also
                        as statues all round the city, many of which depict it being liberated by Lady Liberty.

                    <h2>CINQUE TERRE</h2>
                    <p>Cinque Terre was beyond beautiful. We took the trian between the five towns: Monterosso,
                        Vernazza,
                        Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore. Most of them
                        were situated in the bottom of a valley on the coast. We would hike up into the vineyards the
                        surrounded
                        and looked down at the towns.
                        Many of the old grape carts were still sitting up in the hills. These looked like little
                        monorails
                        that
                        wove through the hils and down into town.
                        They looked like they would have been so fun to ride<br><br>
                        We got to drink the most delicious lemoncello made from the lemons they grow there while we
                        shared a
                        giant bowl of
                        the freshest and moat delicious seafood pasta, caught off of the shored there. We wrapped up of
                        day
                        laying on the rocks at the
                        Grotta di Lord Byron near our hostel, after swimming in the warm waters, watching the sun sink
                        over
                        the cliffs.</p>

                    <h2>PISA & POMPEII</h2>
                    <p> Pisa was a quick stop on our drive to Naples for our Pompeii visit. I couldn't be more thankful
                        for
                        the
                        beautiful weather and bright blue
                        skies as the background to my photos for the day. It just blows my mind though, that with so
                        many
                        people
                        holding the tower up, that
                        it is still leaning that much.<br><br>
                        I wish we could have spent more time in Pompeii and explore more but we were on a guided tour so
                        time
                        was limited. Ite
                        was very interedsting to see the old shop fronts along with the cooking pot. <br><br>
                        I had watched some documentatries on Pompeii nad in a recent one I had learned tht it was quite
                        a
                        raunchy
                        place, one could find phallic carvings in the cobble stones pointing to the location of the
                        brothels, we
                        were able to find one.<br><br>
                        Another interesting sight was just seeing the level of the ash and soot based on the height that
                        was
                        preserved
                        of the buildings. We also saw many casts of the preserves residents and animals. It was sad to
                        learn
                        how
                        trapped they really were.
                        Many were warned of the disaster that could have occured, but if they left that was it. No
                        matter
                        what,
                        they would have lost their homes and
                        any posessions that they couldn't bring with them. There was a high possiblity that if they left
                        the
                        city they could have been captured
                        and trapped into slavery. Many figured they would rather chance what nature had in storefro
                        them.
                        The explosion was so violent that Mt. Vesuvius split into two. The double peaks stand as
                        beautiful and as haunting as they did all of those years
                        ago.

                    <h2>FLORENCE</h2>
                    <p>Florence was quite amazing. One of the most memoriable moments was when we climbed the Duomo di
                        Firenze. There was a competition held for the design of the dome
                        between two master goldsmiths, Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi. Brunnelleschi won
                        while
                        Ghiberti went on to design the bronze doors of the Baptistery, which were also a sight to
                        behold.
                        The Dome is the third tallest in the world and
                        and based on measurements should physcally be impossible. No lives were lost in the creation of
                        the
                        376' tall dome. <br><br>
                        463 steps will take you to the top of the Dome but the trip is not for those scared of tight,
                        dark
                        spaces. Many places there is no room for 2 people to squeee
                        past each other and some steps require you to stoop down while climbing the very steep steps.
                        The
                        views of Floence though are breathtaking!<br><br>
                        I vowed to try some of the regional dishes of each location that we visited. We stummbled on a
                        small
                        cafe where the owner blew us away with how smoothly she transitioned
                        between, Italian, English, and French. I ordered the typical Florentine dish, lampredotto. This
                        caused the owner to do a double take hearing an American
                        order the sandwhich. Lampredotto is a sandwhich made of the fourth stomach of a cow. It is slow
                        cooked in a vegetabkle broth with herbs, and chopped into stripes.
                        It was served on a bun that was dipped in the broth and coated with a spicy green sauce. It was
                        one
                        of the most delicious sandwhiches that I had ever had.
                        Very flavorful, similar to chewier pulled pork but not as heavy feeling. </p>
