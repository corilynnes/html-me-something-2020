            <h2> VENICE</h2>
            <p class='text-column'>I wish I could live in Venice, but at 700&euro; per square foot (roughly $1000 per
                square foot). That is not
                happening.
                I loved the lack of streets and endless systems of alleyways that you could get lost in and yet easily
                find your
                way back home. One evening we stumbled on a residential area
                that was not crawling with tourists. We found a small potluck celebrating Venice with a band, food, and
                Venice
                merchandise. Then shortly
                after we stumbled on a small band playing at another old well courtyard with people dancing and singling
                along.
                <br>
                For a couple days, I had been trying to hunt down a cotton Venetian flag to bring home. I finally found
                one in a
                small shop and the
                cashier was so excited to practice his English and give me a history lesson about the flag and city.
                Speaking of
                history, Venice has such a rich
                history which includes being excommunicated six times. St. Mark became their patron saint by well, being
                stolen,
                literally. Venetian
                merchants stole the body of St. Mark to build a cathedral around his bones. You can find his loin not
                only on
                their flag, but also
                as statues all round the city, many of which depict it being liberated by Lady Liberty.

            <h2>CINQUE TERRE</h2>
            <p>Cinque Terre was beyond beautiful. We took the trian between the five towns: Monterosso, Vernazza,
                Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore. Most of them
                were situated in the bottom of a valley on the coast. We would hike up into the vineyards the surrounded
                and looked down at the towns.
                Many of the old grape carts were still sitting up in the hills. These looked like little monorails that
                wove through the hils and down into town.
                They looked like they would have been so fun to ride<br>
                We got to drink the most delicious lemoncello made from the lemons they grow there while we shared a giant bowl of
            the freshest and moat delicious seafood pasta, caught off of the shored there. We wrapped up of day laying on the rocks at the 
            Grotta di Lord Byron near our hostel, after swimming in the warm waters, watching the sun sink over the cliffs.</p>

            <h2>PISA & POMPEII</h2>
            <p> Pisa was a quick stop on our drive to Naples for our Pompeii visit. I couldn't be more thankful for the
                beautiful weather and bright blue
                skies as the background to my photos for the day. It just blows my mind though, that with so many people
                holding the tower up, that
                it is still leaning that much.<br>
                I wish we could have spent more time in Pompeii and explore more but we were on a guided tour so time
                was limited. Ite
                was very interedsting to see the old shop fronts along with the cooking pot. <br>
                I had watched some documentatries on Pompeii nad in a recent one I had learned tht it was quite a
                raunchy
                place, one could find phallic carvings in the cobble stones pointing to the location of the brothels, we
                were able to find one.<br>
                Another interesting sight was just seeing the level of the ash and soot based on the height that was
                preserved
                of the buildings. We also saw many casts of the preserves residents and animals. It was sad to learn how
                trapped they really were.
                Many were warned of the disaster that could have occured, but if they left that was it. No matter what,
                they would have lost their homes and
                any posessions that they couldn't bring with them. There was a high possiblity that if they left the
                city they could have been captured
                and trapped into slavery. Many figured they would rather chance what nature had in storefro them. THe
                explosion was so violent that Mt. Vesuvius split
                into two. The double peaks stand as beautiful and as haunting as they did all of those years ago.
